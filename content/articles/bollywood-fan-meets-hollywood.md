# Introduction to Bollywood Meets Hollywood
As a music editor, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of different cultures in the entertainment industry. Recently, I came across an interesting article about a Bollywood fan who is making waves in Hollywood. Zainab Azizi, the producer of the movie "Send Help", is a self-proclaimed fan of Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aishwarya Rai. This got me thinking - what happens when Bollywood meets Hollywood?

## Details of the Crossover
The movie "Send Help" has been making headlines with its unique blend of horror and comedy. The film features Rachel McAdams and Dylan O'Brien stranded on a desert island, and the reviews have been delightful. But what's more interesting is the fact that the producer, Zainab Azizi, is a huge fan of Bollywood stars. This crossover of cultures is not new, but it's definitely exciting to see how it plays out in the entertainment industry.
