The world of esports has been growing at an unprecedented rate, with millions of fans tuning in to watch their favorite teams and players compete in various games. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken notice of this trend and has been exploring the possibility of including esports in the Olympic Games. However, the future of Olympic Esports Games remains uncertain, with many questions still unanswered.

## Introduction to Esports in the Olympics
The IOC has been discussing the inclusion of esports in the Olympics for several years, with the first esports tournament being held at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia. The tournament was a success, with many fans attending and watching online. Since then, the IOC has been working with the International Esports Federation (IESF) to develop a plan for including esports in the Olympics. According to an article on ScreenRant (https://screenrant.com), the IOC is considering including esports as a medal sport in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

## Challenges Facing Olympic Esports Games
Despite the growing popularity of esports, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before it can be included in the Olympics. One of the main challenges is the lack of standardization in esports, with different games and genres having different rules and formats. This makes it difficult to determine which games should be included in the Olympics and how they should be played. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential impact of esports on the traditional Olympic sports, with some arguing that it could distract from the core sports and values of the Olympics. As noted by Vulture (https://www.vulture.com), the IOC needs to balance the interests of traditional sports with the growing demand for esports.
