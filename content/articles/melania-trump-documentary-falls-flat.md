The highly anticipated documentary about former First Lady Melania Trump has failed to impress audiences and critics alike. Despite the hype surrounding the film, it has opened to underwhelming reception, with many describing it as "not a gripping film." This lackluster response is a testament to the divisive nature of American politics, with some theaters showing the documentary to packed houses, while others remained empty.

## Background and Reception
The documentary, which aims to provide an intimate look at the life of Melania Trump, has been met with lukewarm reviews from critics. According to Rolling Stone (https://www.rollingstone.com), the film is "not even good propaganda," failing to effectively convey its message or provide any meaningful insight into the life of the former First Lady. This sentiment is echoed by other critics, who have described the film as a "gilded trash remake of The Zone of Interest."
