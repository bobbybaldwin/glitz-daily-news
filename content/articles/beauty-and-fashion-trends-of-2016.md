## The Rise of Athleisure Wear
One of the most significant trends to emerge in 2016 was the rise of athleisure wear. This genre-bending style, which combines the comfort and practicality of athletic wear with the fashion-forward sensibility of high-end clothing, was everywhere in 2016. From the catwalks of London and Milan to the sidewalks of New York and Los Angeles, athleisure wear was the go-to choice for fashionistas and celebrities alike. As noted by Pitchfork, the influence of athleisure wear can even be seen in the music industry, with many artists incorporating athletic wear into their stage costumes and music videos.

## Beauty Trends of 2016
In the beauty world, 2016 was all about bold, statement-making looks. Contouring, which involves using makeup to create the illusion of defined facial features, was a major trend, with many celebrities and influencers showcasing their contouring skills on social media. Another key trend was the rise of natural, effortless beauty, with many women embracing their natural texture and complexion rather than trying to achieve a flawless, airbrushed look. As reported by IGN, the gaming industry also saw a surge in beauty and fashion-themed games, with titles like "Style Savvy" and "Fashion Designer" allowing players to create and customize their own virtual clothing and makeup looks.
