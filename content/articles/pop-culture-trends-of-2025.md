From the resurgence of 90s fashion to the continued rise of streaming services, this year has seen its fair share of trends that have captivated audiences and left a lasting impact on the entertainment industry. According to a recent article in Entertainment Weekly (https://ew.com), the past year has been marked by a renewed interest in nostalgia, with many popular TV shows and movies drawing inspiration from decades past.

## The Resurgence of Nostalgia
