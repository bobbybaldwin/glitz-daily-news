The world of esports has been on a rapid rise in recent years, with professional gamers and teams competing in various tournaments and leagues around the globe. One of the most significant developments in this space has been the inclusion of esports in the Olympic Games. However, the future of Olympic esports games is now uncertain, leaving many in the industry wondering what's next.

## Background and History
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) first recognized esports as a sport in 2017, and since then, there have been several efforts to incorporate it into the Olympic program. In 2020, the IOC announced that esports would be included in the Olympic Virtual Series, a virtual tournament featuring five sports: baseball, cycling, rowing, sailing, and shooting. However, the IOC has yet to confirm whether esports will be included in the 2024 Paris Olympics or the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

The uncertainty surrounding Olympic esports games has sparked a heated debate among industry experts, gamers, and fans. Some argue that esports has the potential to attract a new and younger audience to the Olympics, while others believe that it may dilute the traditional Olympic experience. According to a report by Variety (https://variety.com), the IOC is still grappling with the idea of how to incorporate esports into the Olympic program without compromising the integrity of traditional sports.
